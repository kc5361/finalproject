My name is Rainie Chen (I don’t prefer to tell your my legal name, because I know you guy will pronounce it in an awful way), I was born and raised in Beijing, and while I might look like a typical East “A”sian on the outside, I hope you can get to know the real me. Reflecting on my past, three things deeply influenced me before college: my high school life, makeup addiction, and my passion for anime. Each of these played an essential role in shaping who I am today, and I am grateful for every experience I’ve had. My various identities represent different facets of me, making me a multi-dimensional and ATTRACTIVE person ；））））

My high school years were incredibly joyful (though there’s no denying the IB Diploma was tough LOL). I was always a top student and teachers’ favorite. Because of excellent grade, some of my rebellious behaviors were tolerated. Since high school, I enjoyed hanging out with the art students—the most rebellious group in school. Art students date, skip classes, get piercings, and live through all the stereotypical teenage drama. Yet, I was drawn to this vibe. Everyone had their own spark, unique hobbies, and interests. Instead of hanging with nerds, I preferred sneaking out of evening self-study to observe everyone in the art classroom. This lifestyle defined my entire high school experience and helped me meet the best friends of my life.

I am skilled and passionate about makeup, though I only wear it on weekends when going out with friends. Some have asked if I wear makeup because I lack confidence, but that’s not the case—I know I’m not bad-looking! The truth is, I simply want to present my best self to my friends and leave them with memories of me at my most beautiful. Putting on makeup is also a relaxing process for me: my eyes become a canvas for creative expression. I love using beautiful colors to make my eyes stand out. Unfortunately, I’ve always wanted to attend a professional makeup school but never had the chance.

Like most East Asian kids, I’m fascinated by anime. Beyond mainstream Japanese works, I also enjoy smaller studio animations like Metal Family and the recent hit Digital Circus. I cosplay as my favorite characters and even create fan works, which I share them on platforms like AO3, X, and Tumblr (in the past, like during my middle school).
