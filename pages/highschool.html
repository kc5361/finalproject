		<article><p>My high school years were incredibly joyful (though there’s no denying the IB Diploma was tough LOL). I was always a top student and teachers’ favorite. Because of excellent grade, some of my rebellious behaviors were tolerated. Since high school, I enjoyed hanging out with the art students—the most rebellious group in school. Art students date, skip classes, get piercings, and live through all the stereotypical teenage drama. Yet, I was drawn to this vibe. Everyone had their own spark, unique hobbies, and interests. Instead of hanging with nerds, I preferred sneaking out of evening self-study to observe everyone in the art classroom. This lifestyle defined my entire high school experience and helped me meet the best friends of my life.</p></article>
